
// QUESTION 1

//  There are Three(3) ways of DOM Manipulation as we have learnt, they are as follows:

//  1) ID: Method:  getElementById()
    
//     Note: We can grab an element by ID with the getElementById() method of the document object.
//           In order to be accessed by ID, the HTML element must have an id attribute.

//  2) Class: Method:  getElementByClassName()
    
//  Note: We can grab an element by class name with the getElementByClassName() method of the document object.
//        In order to be accessed by class name, the HTML element must have an class attribute.
       
//  3) TagName: Method:  getElementByTagName()
    
//  Note: We can grab an element by TagName with the getElementByTagName() method of the document object.
//        In order to be accessed by TagName, the HTML element must have a tag(Example h1 tag).
